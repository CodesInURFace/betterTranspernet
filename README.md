**Hey!**
This is a remake of the [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp) transparent theme made for the new look of [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)

**Plus!** some plugins that just makes discord look **SO** much better.

**How to add a theme**

To add a theme/style you can either, edit the CSS for a few lines of CSS code or for much bigger themes you can add the THEME.css to C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes in Windows, ~/Library/Preferences/BetterDiscord/themes in OSX, or where ever the BetterDiscord folder is located, fully close down discord, reopen and click the theme you want in the settings.
